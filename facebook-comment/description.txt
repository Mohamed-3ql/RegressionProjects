ABSTRACT='The leading treads towards social networking services had drawn massive 
public attention from last one and half decade. The amount of data that is 
uploaded to these social networking services is increasing day by day. So, 
there is massive requirement to study the highly dynamic behavior of users 
towards these services. This is a preliminary work to model the user 
patterns and to study the effectiveness of machine learning predictive 
modeling approaches on leading social networking service Facebook. We 
modeled the user comment patters, over the posts on Facebook Pages and 
predicted that how many comments a post is expected to receive in next H 
hrs. In order to automate the process, we developed a software prototype 
consisting of the crawler, Information extractor, information processor and 
knowledge discovery module. We used Neural Networks and Decision Trees, 
predictive modeling techniques on different dataset variants and evaluated 
them under Hits(at)10 (custom measure), Area Under Curve, Evaluation Time 
and Mean Absolute error evaluation metrics. We concluded that the Decision 
trees performed better than the Neural Networks under light of all 
evaluation metrics.'
